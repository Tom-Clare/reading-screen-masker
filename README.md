> There was once a very great American surgeon named Halsted. He was married to a nurse. He loved her immeasurably. One day Halsted noticed that his wifeâ€™s hands were chapped and red when she came back from surgery. And so he invented rubber gloves. For her. It is one of the great love stories in medicine. The difference between inspired medicine and uninspired medicine is love.
> When I met Ana I knew:
> I loved her to the point of invention.

# Overview
RoseSuite aims to be a free and open package to help students and workers focus and study, taking the form of a series of chrome extensions. Special attention is given to tools that provide a higher level of accessibility to those with difficulties.

# Roadmap
Development will progress and new components will be added when they're ready. We have a number of goals that are outlined below.

**Current Functionality:**
* A resizeable masking feature to darken above and below the cursor so that attention is kept to relevent parts of the screen.
* The mask can be turned on and off via a popup or via a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+M, Cmd+M).
* A compelling logo
* A well-structured user interface.

**Goals:**
* A citation helper with a number of well-used templates
* Smooth design of using and changing in-use citation templates

**Nice-to-haves:**
* A pomodoro timer
* Support for user-customisable citation templates

## A note about price
RoseSuite is free and always will be. Access to education should be available for all, even those with difficulties studying. This project will also remain open source, allowing anyone to see, download, and run this code.
