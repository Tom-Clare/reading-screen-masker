# RoseSuite
RoseSuite aims to be a free and open package to help students and workers focus and study, taking the form of a chrome extension. Special attention is given to tools that provide a higher level of accessibility to those with difficulties.


Current features:
- A (somewhat) customisable masking feature to darken above and below the cursor so that attention is kept to relevent parts of the screen. 

Future features:
- A pomodoro timer.
- A reference maker (with university and established standards templates).

All for free :)
